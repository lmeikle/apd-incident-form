## APD Front End Tech Test

#### Notes:
- For speed I have spun up the application using Create React App (with Typescript)

- I have chosen to use the Formik library to handle form validation/errors etc..
It's saves writing alot of the boilerplate code associated with forms, I would always recommend it.
I have done some simple manual validation of the form fields.

- To get something looking beautiful with little effort I have used the Semantic UI component library.
I could have just styled everything myself but again I choose this for speed.

- I have implemented the date/time field as a text input field, however we could choose to add a date picker UI component.

#### Original Brief:
In order to show off your creativity and coding skills; please can you create a web page containing a tool to 
record basic information about an incident that has occurred somewhere in the city. 
The reporter must be able to record at least the following information about the incident:

- A summary or title
- Extended details
- Date & time it happened
- Precise location where it happened

We’ve been non-specific about the details; we’re interested in how you choose to do it as much as the result. 
It’s a simple task so don’t spend many hours on it. Write something tiny and perhaps a couple of sentences about your thinking.

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
